**Description**: AI-Enhanced Affiliate Network Bulk Submission Platform
Welcome to the development overview of our cutting-edge Affiliate Network Bulk Submission Platform. This project leverages the latest technologies and APIs to create a powerful, efficient, and user-friendly system for managing affiliate program applications at scale.

Key Features
1. User Authentication
Secure user registration and login powered by Firebase Authentication.


// Firebase Authentication setup
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth, createUserWithEmailAndPassword, signInWithEmailAndPassword } from 'firebase/auth';

const firebaseConfig = {
  // Your Firebase configuration
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);

// User registration
const registerUser = async (email, password) => {
  try {
    const userCredential = await createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
    return userCredential.user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error registering user:', error);
  }
};

// User login
const loginUser = async (email, password) => {
  try {
    const userCredential = await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
    return userCredential.user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error logging in:', error);
  }
};
    
2. Affiliate Program Database
Efficient storage and management of affiliate program details using MongoDB Atlas.


// MongoDB Atlas setup
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb+srv://your-connection-string', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
});

const AffiliateProgram = mongoose.model('AffiliateProgram', {
  name: String,
  description: String,
  applicationUrl: String,
  commission: String,
  requirements: [String]
});

// Create a new affiliate program
const createAffiliateProgram = async (programData) => {
  try {
    const program = new AffiliateProgram(programData);
    await program.save();
    return program;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating affiliate program:', error);
  }
};

// Retrieve affiliate programs
const getAffiliatePrograms = async () => {
  try {
    return await AffiliateProgram.find();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving affiliate programs:', error);
  }
};
    
3. Bulk Application Submission
Automate form submissions to multiple affiliate programs using Puppeteer and handle CAPTCHAs with Death by CAPTCHA.


const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const DeathByCaptcha = require('deathbycaptcha');

const client = new DeathByCaptcha('YOUR_DBC_USERNAME', 'YOUR_DBC_PASSWORD');

const submitApplication = async (url, formData) => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  await page.goto(url);

  // Fill out the form
  for (const [field, value] of Object.entries(formData)) {
    await page.type(`input[name="${field}"]`, value);
  }

  // Handle CAPTCHA if present
  const captchaImg = await page.$('img#captcha');
  if (captchaImg) {
    const captchaBase64 = await captchaImg.screenshot({ encoding: 'base64' });
    const captcha = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      client.decode({ base64: captchaBase64 }, (err, result) => {
        if (err) reject(err);
        else resolve(result.text);
      });
    });
    await page.type('input#captcha-solution', captcha);
  }

  await page.click('input[type="submit"]');
  await page.waitForNavigation();

  await browser.close();
};
    
Next Steps
To proceed with the development of this platform:

Set up the development environment with Node.js and necessary dependencies.
Configure Firebase project for authentication and real-time database.
Set up MongoDB Atlas for storing affiliate program details.
Implement the frontend using React or your preferred framework.
Develop backend API endpoints for handling affiliate program data and form submissions.
Integrate Puppeteer for automated form submissions and Death by CAPTCHA for CAPTCHA solving.
Implement user dashboard for tracking application statuses and managing profiles.
Test thoroughly and deploy the application.
Remember to prioritize security and scalability throughout the development process. Good luck with your project! 

## Who is the owner of this repository?
By default, GPT Engineer projects are created with public GitHub repositories.

However, you can easily transfer the repository to your own GitHub account by navigating to your [GPT Engineer project](https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/6d88ea6c-44ab-4e94-ac1b-b215cf8eb5c6/improve) and selecting Settings -> GitHub. 

## How can I edit this code?
There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use GPT Engineer**

Simply visit the GPT Engineer project at [GPT Engineer](https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/6d88ea6c-44ab-4e94-ac1b-b215cf8eb5c6/improve) and start prompting.

Changes made via gptengineer.app will be committed automatically to this repo.

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in the GPT Engineer UI.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GPT-Engineer-App/affiliate-automation-guru.git
cd affiliate-automation-guru
npm i

# This will run a dev server with auto reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.

To use GitHub Pages you will need to follow these steps: 
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
- Configure a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
